My scripts for the [Global Wheat Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection/) competition.

### Tasks
- `load_cutmix_image_and_boxes` feature has to be added from the EffDet kernel

### Might be useful
- [End to End Object Detection with Transformers:DETR](https://www.kaggle.com/tanulsingh077/end-to-end-object-detection-with-transformers-detr)
#### For now I'm follwing [this](https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/training-efficientdet) wonderful kernel.
